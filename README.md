# spdxSummarizer

## About

spdxSummarizer is a terminal-based set of tools for importing, analyzing and generating reports about files and licenses.

It imports [SPDXÂ®](https://spdx.org/) tag-value files, and processes, categorizes and reports the license clearing results in various formats.

## Workflow and usage

The intended workflow is:
1. obtain an SPDX tag-value file, such as by exporting it from a suitable license scanning tool;
2. import that tag-value file into spdxSummarizer; and
3. use spdxSummarizer to generate reports.

A walkthrough with a usage example, and further details about configuration and features, can be found in the file [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md). Additional documentation is in other files in the `docs/` directory.

spdxSummarizer is _not_, itself, a license scanner. spdxSummarizer does not create SPDX files. It is only useful when used in conjunction with SPDX tag-value files that you've obtained from another source.

spdxSummarizer should be usable with arbitrary SPDX tag-value files, and I have tested it with samples from a handful of different sources. I would gladly welcome feedback and patches from anyone who tries using spdxSummarizer with SPDX tag-value files generated using various tools.
