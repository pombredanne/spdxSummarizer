# spdxSummarizer

## About

spdxSummarizer is a terminal-based set of tools for importing, analyzing and generating reports about files and licenses.

It imports [SPDXÂ®](https://spdx.org/) tag-value files, and processes, categorizes and reports the license clearing results in various formats.

## Caveats

spdxSummarizer is _not_, itself, a license scanner. spdxSummarizer does not create SPDX files. It is only useful when used in conjunction with SPDX tag-value files that you've obtained from another source.

spdxSummarizer should be usable with arbitrary SPDX files. However, at present (2017-09-27) I have only tested it with SPDX tag-value files generated by [FOSSology](https://www.fossology.org/). I would gladly welcome feedback and patches from anyone who tries using spdxSummarizer with SPDX tag-value files generated using other tools.

## Workflow and usage

The intended workflow is:
1. obtain an SPDX tag-value file, such as by exporting it from a suitable license scanning tool;
2. import that tag-value file into spdxSummarizer; and
3. use spdxSummarizer to generate reports.

A walkthrough with a usage example, and further details about configuration and features, can be found in the file [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md). Additional documentation is in other files in the `docs/` directory.

## Authors

The initial version of spdxSummarizer was written by Steve Winslow and is Copyright (C) 2017 The Linux Foundation.

## Requirements and dependencies

spdxSummarizer requires Python 3.6 or later. spdxSummarizer uses the standard SQLite module included with Python 3.6.

The only non-standard dependency used by spdxSummarizer is [XlsxWriter](https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter), which should be installed using pip. XlsxWriter is provided under the BSD-2-Clause-FreeBSD license.

As described above, spdxSummarizer is only useful in conjunction with SPDX files. SPDX is a registered trademark of The Linux Foundation.
